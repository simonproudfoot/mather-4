Their large hollow heads and lightweight graphite shafts ensure a fast swing to generate as much power as possible. Be warned though – with speed comes more spin and more wayward shots. Whether a club or Major championship, a drive from the 18th tee can be nerve-wracking for all of us!'

Like drivers, their shafts are usually lightweight graphite. Fairway woods send the ball long distances, so you might also play a 3 or 5-wood from the tee for a bit more accuracy than a driver.'

They combine the distance of long irons with the forgiveness of a fairway wood – and are just as comfortable from the rough as the fairway. In the right hands they can make just about any shot.'

            text: 'Your drive has you on the fairway – now, to approach the green, look to your irons. With their steel heads and shafts, irons are normally heavier than your driver and woods. Irons are divided into long, medium and short irons, relative to how far they send the ball. Long irons with a lower loft punch the ball low and far but are among the hardest clubs to master. Higher lofted mid- and short-irons are good for shorter, accurate shots, flying high and landing softly on the green. Irons allow for amazing creativity depending on the course and conditions.'

Pitching and lob wedges help you chip or pitch the ball short distances, over hazards or out of the rough. The spin generated by your wedges’ high loft lets you control the ball’s movement on the green, cutting it back or stopping it dead.'

Near or far, you’ll use this club more than any other in the bag, so a keen eye and a steady hand are a must. But beware the dreaded yips!'
